          <p>At a time when the internet is flooded with opinions, assumptions, and agendas, NewsYatra adheres to a strict set of editorial values:</p>
          <h3 className='about-subheading'>✅ Accuracy</h3>

          <h3 className='about-subheading'>⚖️ Fairness</h3>

          <h3 className='about-subheading'>🧠 Depth</h3>
          <p>News is more than headlines. We provide the context, background, and implications so you can understand not just what happened, but why it matters.</p>
          <h3 className='about-subheading'>🌐 Accessibility</h3>
          <p>News should be understandable to all. We avoid jargon, explain complex issues in clear language, and make sure our content is easy to navigate across devices.</p>
          <h3 className='about-subheading'>🕵️ Accountability</h3>
